# Tic-Tac-Toe, a game made on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<h1>How the game functions</h1>
<p>This game is automatically running from when you enter the page, the player's turn is indicated above the centerpiece.
To win the game, you must have 3 in a row. It's a classic game so good luck!</p>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p> The design is minimalistic, black and white to simulate playing on a good old fashioned blackboard. All elements are centered for the asthetics and means the page works on mobile extremely well as well as a desktop</p>
