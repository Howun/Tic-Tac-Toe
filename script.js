//Js concepts and functions to be added:

// Add names to player 1 and player 2
// First make it so when a grid is clicked it starts with an X and places it in the grid.
// Make it so when One is pressed it switches to place the alternate symbol.
// Make it so you are not allowed to overlap a grid that has a symbol placed down.
// Add set of rules so once a row of three of the same symbol has been achieved the player who has placed it down wins.
// Add reset game button
// When reset button pressed, animate a reset to flip all squares to blank

// Additional things that could be added in:
// - A tally for how many wins each player has.
// - Reset button specifically for the counter and tally
